## Approach:

The approach will be to analyze a dataset on tortilla prices across various states in Mexico, focusing on data from the years 2007 to 2023. The analysis will differentiate between store types, specifically Mom-and-Pop stores versus Big Retailers. We will filter and clean the data to ensure accuracy, then use statistical methods to compare the average prices of tortillas between different store types and states. By leveraging visualizations and statistical analysis, we aim to identify trends and correlations in tortilla pricing, examining how regional and store type variations impact the overall pricing landscape.

## Data Source:

The primary data source for this project will be the dataset on tortilla prices available on Kaggle. You can access it at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/richave/tortilla-prices-in-mexico. This dataset provides comprehensive information required for our analysis, including pricing data across various states and store types. We will utilize this data to perform various analytical methods to derive meaningful insights.
